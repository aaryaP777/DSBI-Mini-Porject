# Employee Attrition and HR Analytics

## Project Overview

This project aims to predict **employee attrition** (the rate at which employees leave an organization) using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various factors that contribute to employee turnover, the model helps HR departments take proactive actions to reduce attrition and improve employee retention strategies.

## What is Attrition?

**Attrition** refers to the loss of employees from an organization, whether through resignation, retirement, or termination. High attrition rates can be costly for businesses, leading to increased recruitment and training costs, as well as loss of expertise and productivity.

In this project, attrition is categorized as whether an employee stays or leaves the company, represented as a binary classification problem (Yes/No).

## Why is Attrition Useful for Organizations?

Understanding and predicting attrition is crucial for businesses because it helps them:

- **Improve Employee Retention**: By identifying factors that lead to attrition, companies can implement strategies to retain top talent and reduce turnover.
- **Reduce Costs**: High attrition rates can be expensive due to the costs associated with recruiting, onboarding, and training new employees.
- **Enhance Employee Satisfaction**: Analyzing employee feedback and behavior can uncover areas for improvement in company policies, work environment, and compensation strategies.
- **Optimize Workforce Planning**: Predicting which employees are at risk of leaving helps HR plan for workforce changes and avoid sudden vacancies in critical roles.

## How We Do It

We approach the problem of predicting employee attrition using **machine learning** techniques. Specifically, we use two popular algorithms:

### 1. Random Forest Classifier
A **Random Forest** is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and merges their results. Itâ€™s particularly good at handling large datasets and capturing complex relationships between features (such as employee demographics, job satisfaction, and compensation).

By aggregating the predictions of many trees, Random Forest helps us achieve higher accuracy and reduce overfitting.

### 2. Logistic Regression
**Logistic Regression** is a statistical method used for binary classification. It models the probability of a categorical dependent variable based on one or more independent variables (such as age, salary, or performance rating).

While simple, Logistic Regression is effective for understanding how different factors contribute to the likelihood of attrition.

Both algorithms are trained on historical employee data and used to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the company. By analyzing the results, HR departments can focus on high-risk employees and implement measures to prevent attrition.

## Data Used

The project uses a dataset that includes various attributes of employees, such as:

- **Demographics**: Age, Gender, Marital Status
- **Job-related Information**: Job Role, Job Satisfaction, Work Environment
- **Compensation**: Salary, Bonus, Benefits
- **Performance**: Training, Performance Rating, Tenure
